# How to get info through API calls with simple CLI-Scripts

Wherever possible, this category will show you, how you can get information from your local ledger or from a WalletServer by using the Bismuth API. The idea is to show you in an evolutionary-like structure, how you can achieve this.
First step will be simplest to show you, what a call returns (for example get your balance from your local node). In the second step, we show you in detail, how you can achieve this, with the bis infrastructure, without having a node running locally. The third step then will present a clean and easy way with ready to use functions.

The first thing we show is the mentioned "How to get your balance".
